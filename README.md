# MMM-PrayerTime-Issues

Hi Slamet PS. I am new to this stuff. started playing with raspberry pi during these lockdown days. I recently used your MMM-PrayerTime module for my magic mirror.

currently i am showing prayer time and sunrise on my screen. i found 2 following issues.

1. adhan plays on time but stops at the very end of adhan. i mean it doesn't play full adhan.
2. secondly it starts playing adhan at sunrie time. which is not right.

can you please look at the above issues and give me some updates here or let me know i will give you my email address.

Any Update brother?
